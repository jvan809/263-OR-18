Demand Estimations
To formulate an appropriate estimation of the number of pellets required at each store on each day we computed  an average of the required pellets each day for each respective store. Modelling the average by each day is significantly more accurate than simply computing an average of each store’s required pellets as a single value (averaging of all demands over the period). Store demands would vary day to day depending on consumer tendencies, for example stores may require the most pellets on a day like Monday potentially because all WoolWorth stores are closed on Sunday and SuperValue and FreshChoice are closed on Saturday as well. Opposed to a day like Saturday with Countdown stores receiving the lowest daily requirement of pellets and this could be potentially because it’s a weekend and people are not looking to shop. If we were to model the store demands daily with a single figure it would mean on days like Saturday the store warehouse would be possibly overstocked and on days like Monday where the estimated demand is lower than the required amount of pellets the store would be understocked. The stores hold commodities (food/groceries) that go obsolete and so overstocking can be the cause of loss in profits due to write offs or lowered prices near expiration dates. Understocking also negativity impacts profits as it means they can’t meet the consumer demand and losses in potential sales and potential profits. Therefore managing inventory and  maintaining an optimal number of pellets for each respective store is best for profits and is estimated most accurately by computing an average of the required pellets each day for each respective store.
